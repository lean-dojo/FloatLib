# Deterministic nearest-even quotient rounding

Format-independent nearest-even rounding for a natural quotient and remainder. The executable
decision uses only quotient parity and the remainder, so optimized kernels can recover the same
result without constructing a large scaled numerator.

/--
Whether a quotient should increase when rounding a nonnegative quotient and remainder to nearest,
with an exact halfway case sent to the even integer.

Only the quotient's parity is needed. Keeping that fact explicit lets callers handle very large
scaled numerators through modular arithmetic without first constructing the full quotient.

@[inline] def nearestEvenRoundsUp
    (quotientOdd : Bool) (remainder denominator : Nat) : Bool :=
  let twiceRemainder := 2 * remainder
  denominator < twiceRemainder ||
    (denominator == twiceRemainder && quotientOdd)

/--
Round `numerator / denominator` to the nearest natural number, breaking exact halfway cases toward
the even result.

The function is total. Callers that assign mathematical quotient semantics must establish that
`denominator` is nonzero: with `denominator = 0`, Lean's conventions `n / 0 = 0` and `n % 0 = n`
make the result `0` for `numerator = 0` and `1` otherwise. The native kernel
`FixedWord.roundQuotientEven` returns `0` for a zero denominator instead, so its refinement
theorem assumes a nonzero denominator.

@[inline] def roundQuotientEven (numerator denominator : Nat) : Nat :=
  let quotient := numerator / denominator
  let remainder := numerator % denominator
  let twice := 2 * remainder
  if twice < denominator then
    quotient
  else if denominator < twice then
    quotient + 1
  else if quotient % 2 == 0 then
    quotient
  else
    quotient + 1

/--
Nearest-even quotient rounding either retains the integer quotient or increases it by one.

The decision depends only on the remainder and quotient parity. This form is useful for optimized
algorithms that recover those two facts through modular arithmetic without constructing a very
large scaled numerator.
