# Rounding Predicates

Semantic specifications for directed, toward-zero, and nearest rounding.  They are independent of
any radix or concrete format: a predicate `F : ℝ → Prop` identifies the representable values, and
the point predicates characterize the required output among those values.

These definitions correspond to Flocq's `Rnd_DN_pt`, `Rnd_UP_pt`, `Rnd_ZR_pt`, and `Rnd_N_pt`.
