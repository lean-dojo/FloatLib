# Reference arithmetic with exact dyadic intermediates

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and fused multiply-add share one specification method:
decode finite operands exactly, compute the dyadic intermediate, and round once to nearest with
ties to even. Exceptional operands follow the descriptor's NaN, infinity, overflow, and zero
policy. In particular, FMA does not round its product before adding the third operand.

These definitions are the stable proof targets for the dispatched arithmetic kernels. Quotients
use the rational specification in `Spec.Division`; roots use `Spec.SquareRoot`. Explicit rounding
directions and exception-status results belong to their separate operation APIs.

These specifications also execute when a backend declines an operand. The rounding refinement
must be imported before they are defined: it replaces the logical rounder's repeated one-bit
shifts with bulk integer rounding in their compiled code.

Subtraction as addition of the negated right operand.

`neg` toggles the stored sign bit of every word in a signed-zero format, so a NaN propagated from
`y` is returned with its sign bit flipped relative to `y`. IEEE 754-2019 Section 6.3 leaves the
sign of a NaN result unspecified, so this sign choice is allowed. Callers comparing NaN words
bit for bit should not expect `sub x y` to return `y`'s NaN unchanged. In the finite-unsigned-zero
encoding `neg` leaves the NaN word unchanged, so no flip occurs there. The dispatched `Model.sub`
and its backends are proved equal to this definition, so the convention is shared by every format.
